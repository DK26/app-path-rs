## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-07

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Replaced `try_new()` with infallible `new()`** - Constructor now panics on system failure instead of returning `Result`
- **Removed `input()` method and `input_path` field** - No longer stores the original input path for cleaner API
- **Replaced `TryFrom` with `From` trait implementations** - Conversions are now infallible 
- **Removed `AppPath::with_base()` method** - This method was confusing and broke the core mental model of "paths relative to executable"
- **Changed constructor parameter** - Now accepts `impl AsRef<Path>` instead of `impl Into<PathBuf>` for zero-allocation optimization

**Migration Guide:**
```rust
// 0.1.2 (old)
let config = AppPath::try_new("config.toml")?;
let input_path = config.input(); // No longer available
let custom = AppPath::with_base(&dir, "file.txt");

// 0.2.0 (new) 
let config = AppPath::new("config.toml"); // Infallible
// input_path no longer needed - simplified API
let custom = AppPath::new(dir.join("file.txt")); // Use standard Path::join
```

### Added
- **Infallible API design** - `new()` constructor that panics on rare system failures
- **Static executable directory caching** - Uses `OnceLock` for optimal performance  
- Comprehensive trait implementations: `Default`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`, `Hash`, `Deref<Target=Path>`, `Borrow<Path>`
- Enhanced collection integration - `AppPath` now works seamlessly in `HashMap`, `BTreeSet`, etc.
- `Default` implementation that points to the executable directory
- Direct `Path` method access via `Deref` (e.g., `app_path.extension()`)
- Efficient collection lookups via `Borrow<Path>`
- Comprehensive error handling examples and fallback patterns

### Enhanced
- **Simplified API design** - Now focused on the core use case: "paths relative to executable"
- **Improved testing patterns** - Use standard `Path::join()` for custom test directories
- **Cleaner documentation** - Removed confusing examples and focused on practical usage
- **Zero-allocation optimization** - `#[inline]` attributes on all performance-critical methods
- **Better error handling examples** - Practical fallback patterns using `std::env::current_exe()`

### Performance
- Static caching of executable directory using `OnceLock` for optimal performance on stable Rust
- Aggressive inlining of trait implementations and core methods
- Zero-allocation design for `impl AsRef<Path>` parameters

### Fixed
- **MSRV Compatibility** - Replaced `std::sync::LazyLock` with `std::sync::OnceLock` for stable Rust support (â‰¥1.70)

### Documentation
- Streamlined README focusing on API usage rather than compiler optimizations
- Updated all examples to remove `with_base()` references
- Added comprehensive trait implementation examples
- Improved cognitive load by removing overly technical explanations
- Clear migration guide for users of the removed `with_base()` method

### Internal
- Split tests into dedicated `src/tests.rs` module for better maintainability
- Improved test organization and coverage

## [0.1.2] - 2025-07-06

### Added
- Comprehensive documentation improvements across all files
- Generic `impl Into<PathBuf>` parameter for `try_new()` supporting any path-like type
- Smart path resolution behavior: relative paths resolve to executable directory, absolute paths used as-is
- Ownership transfer optimization for `String` and `PathBuf` types
- Enhanced examples showing different path types and ownership patterns
- Path behavior documentation explaining absolute vs relative path handling

### Enhanced
- README.md with complete feature overview, path behavior section, and ownership examples
- Crate-level documentation with absolute path examples and system integration use cases
- API documentation with detailed behavior explanations for different path types
- Test coverage for absolute path behavior and ownership transfer scenarios

### Performance
- Optimized ownership transfer when moving `String` or `PathBuf` into `AppPath`
- Zero-copy path handling where possible through generic `impl Into<PathBuf>` parameter

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive path resolution behavior documentation
- Enhanced examples showing portable vs system integration use cases
- Complete API coverage with ownership and conversion examples
- Improved testing guidelines and cross-platform compatibility notes

## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- Initial stable release of `app-path` crate
- `AppPath::try_new()` - Create paths relative to executable location
- `AppPath::with_base()` - Override base directory for testing  
- `AppPath::path()` - Get the full resolved path (primary method)
- `AppPath::input()` - Get the original input path before resolution
- `AppPath::exists()` - Check if the path exists
- `AppPath::create_dir_all()` - Create parent directories if needed
- `TryFrom<&str>`, `TryFrom<String>`, and `TryFrom<&String>` implementations for ergonomic string conversions
- Implementation of `Display`, `From<AppPath>`, and `AsRef<Path>` traits
- Zero dependencies - uses only standard library
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Full test suite with CI/CD pipeline

### Fixed
- Improved API design over initial 0.1.0 release

### Notes
- Uses `try_new()` instead of `new()` to follow Rust conventions where `new()` implies infallible construction
- Methods `path()` and `input()` provide clear, intuitive naming
- Multiple ergonomic creation methods via `try_new()` and `TryFrom` traits

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-05

### Added  
- Initial release (yanked - replaced by 0.1.1 with improved API)
