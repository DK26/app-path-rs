# Or run individual checks
cargo fmt --check    # Format check
cargo clippy         # Linting
cargo test           # Unit tests
cargo test --doc     # Documentation tests
cargo doc            # Build docs
```

### Guidelines

**Code Quality:**
- All tests must pass (`./ci-local.sh`)
- No clippy warnings
- Follow `cargo fmt` style
- Add tests for new features

**Project Philosophy:**
- **Simple API** - Easy to use, hard to misuse
- **Zero dependencies** - Keep it lightweight  
- **Cross-platform** - Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Reliable** - Predictable behavior everywhere

## AI Prompt

Copy-paste this when working with AI on this project:

```
Rules: Always run `bash ci-local.sh` before committing. Use modern string formatting in ALL string-building macros - put variables directly in braces like format!("Hello, {name}") instead of format!("Hello, {}", name). Never remove existing APIs or tests. Preserve all public interfaces.
```

## Pull Requests

1. **Fork** and create a feature branch
2. **Write tests** for your changes
3. **Run CI locally**: `./ci-local.sh`
4. **Submit PR** with clear description

All PRs automatically run CI on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
