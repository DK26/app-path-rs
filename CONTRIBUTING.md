## AI Prompt

Copy-paste this when working with AI on this project:

```
Rules: Always run `bash ci-local.sh` before committing. Use modern string formatting in ALL string-building macros - put variables directly in braces like format!("Hello, {name}") instead of format!("Hello, {}", name). Never remove existing APIs or tests. Preserve all public interfaces. Avoid redundant explanations in documentation.
```

## What We Want ✅

- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Better error handling and documentation

## What We Don't Want ❌
